# Customer lifetime value analysis for a contract and non-contract based business

Unfortunately, many businesses calculate CLV using historical customer behavior without accounting for variation in that behavior. For example, a customer who buys several expensive items at once might be assigned a higher value than a customer who consistently buys moderately priced items â€” even if he or she never buys from the business again after the initial purchase. 

There are two classes of business contexts that influence how a data scientist should go about modeling customer lifetime value: 

1. Whether purchases are discrete or continuous.

2. Whether the setting is contractual or non-contractual. 

Discrete purchases occur at fixed periods or frequencies, whereas continuous purchases occur at any time. <strong>Whether purchases are contractual or not determines whether customer churn is visible or must be inferred;</strong> This example is for non-contractual, but you can hook up <strong>AutoML for Customer Churn</strong> project, [here](https://github.com/joehoeller/AutoML-with-Genetic-Algorthims-to-Accurately-Predict-Customer-Churn), for a contractual business.

CLV models can provide lots of actionable information, like the probability that a customer will churn or a population-level prediction of how many orders customers will be placing at a given time. These insights are critical for data-driven retention measures and sales forecasts, respectively.
